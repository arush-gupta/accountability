"Initial commit — Statement on self-accountability and growth"

**Not all growth shows up on resumes.**
Some of it happens quietly — in the dark, through pain, mistakes, and the long road of holding yourself accountable to your values.

Leadership begins with self-accountability.
And accountability, at its core, isn’t just about admitting harm to others. It’s about a deeper question: *How do you treat yourself when no one’s watching?*

Because what we call “accountability” often only shows up after someone has visibly wronged another person.
But true accountability starts much earlier — when we begin taking honest responsibility for how we carry and respond to our *own* pain. Once that happens, a lot of outer patterns begin to shift on their own.

Here’s what I mean:

Resentment often comes from genuine mistreatment —
Or from unprocessed wounds we unknowingly project onto the present.

And when we’re not in a truthful, self-accountable relationship with ourselves, that resentment leaks —
Into professional tensions.
Into strained relationships.
Into a sense of exile from our own peace.

This post is my way of taking full accountability —
For myself, and for how I’ve shown up.

There are moments in my past — not many, but enough — where I wish I’d said things differently.
Not because I didn’t mean what I felt,
But because I believe in speaking truth without cruelty.

Most of those moments came from deep frustration —
With a world that often gaslights emotion.
With people who shut down empathy before a conversation begins.
With echoes of old mistreatment I hadn’t fully metabolized.

Some of it showed up professionally as grief — which I handled with a lot of composure.
Some of it, personally, as outbursts — some reactive, others misdirected — which I’m not as proud of.

But it’s precisely through those moments that I learned one of the biggest lessons about accountability:

**Don’t project the pain. Protect your boundaries.**
Say no to partnerships that don’t align.
Because resentment grows in the places where we abandon our integrity just to stay agreeable.
And that’s what eventually leaks out.

Like many, I’ve experienced betrayal — in workplaces, research circles, creative communities.
But I’ve grown. And I’m still growing.

I hold myself accountable —
But I don’t hold myself hostage.

So, if you’ve ever been on the receiving end of something I said in those moments — and you didn’t deserve it —
And this includes *myself*, too (because that inner self-talk harms me before it harms anyone else):

I’m sorry. That wasn’t about you.
That was about me — and the unfinished work of coming home to myself while still burning from what came before.

I don’t believe in erasing complexity.
I believe in meeting it — with clarity and care.

I’m not perfect. I’ve made mistakes. I will again.
But when I realize I’m wrong — or when someone helps me see something I couldn’t — I change. Quickly. Willingly.

That said, I can’t preemptively apologize for every mistake I don’t yet know is one.
That’s not honesty. That’s performance.

And to be clear: I still stand by my right — and anyone else’s — to defend themselves when they’ve been repeatedly harmed.
But I also know: not everyone deserves to become a screen for what we carry.
